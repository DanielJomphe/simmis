(ns is.simm.model.rpc-coverage-test
  "Every network-reachable RPC is policed.

   `authorize-remote` is deny-by-default, so an RPC with no `rpc-policy` row
   fails CLOSED — refused rather than exposed. That is the safe direction, but
   it makes the omission invisible: the feature is simply dead, and whoever
   added the fn finds out from a user.

   This is the invariant that rots. `rpc-policy` is a table maintained by hand
   beside ~100 registrations spread over twelve namespaces, and nothing about
   writing a `defn-spin-remote` forces you to add a row. So assert the join
   itself, against the LIVE registry rather than a grep — the macro mangles
   names into `<ns>/spin-remote-<name>-<idx>` and only `normalize-remote-name`
   knows how to undo that.

   The HTTP plane gets this guarantee at BOOT instead (reitit's `:validate`
   hook — see `http-auth/validate-auth-declared!`), which is stronger. The RPC
   registry is populated by requiring namespaces rather than by building one
   object, so there is no single construction point to hang it on; a test is
   the available equivalent."
