  "The code-fork lane: a geschichte workspace as the place an agent writes, and
   a named branch as the thing a reviewer decides.

   These pin the TRAPS, not the happy path. Every one of them was found by
   measurement during the build, and each is a silent failure — a wrong call
   here does not throw, it returns something plausible and does nothing. The
   happy path is easy to keep working; what needs a test is the shape of the
   mistake next to it.

   Deliberately at the geschichte/yggdrasil layer rather than through
   `branching/get-repo-system`, which resolves through dvergr's registry and a
   live room context. The invariants below belong to the substrate, so pinning
   them here keeps them fast and keeps them honest: a test that had to
   provision a room could pass because the resolution worked while the
   mechanics were wrong."
