  "Enumerating a branch's tests, and reading a clojure.test report.

   The two halves that are pure enough to pin without a repository. The rest of
   `run-fork-checks!` is fork lifecycle, covered by `repo-fork-test`.

   Why the enumeration matters on its own: it is the ONE definition of \"the
   tests on this branch\", shared by the independent check and by the agent's
   own `run_tests`. Before it they disagreed — clojure.test enumerates the vars
   a session has LOADED, so an agent that wrote a test file and never required
   it ran zero tests and was told everything passed, while the check at review
   time read the file and found the failure. Green while working, red in front
   of the reviewer, which is the worst direction for the two to differ in."
