  "REPL conveniences for the running dev system.

   Loaded into `user`, so everything here is callable unqualified at the
   prompt and in a one-liner:

       clj-nrepl-eval -p 47888 \"(status)\"
       clj-nrepl-eval -p 47888 \"(rooms)\"

   The point is to remove three things that cost time every session: writing
   the same `require` before every probe, writing a datalog query to answer
   \"what rooms exist\", and answering \"is it actually up and is the bundle
   current\" from outside the JVM with `ss`, `grep` and `ls -la`.

   Everything here READS. Nothing in this namespace mutates the system —
   lifecycle lives in `user` (start!/stop!/restart-web!) where it is harder to
   call by accident."
