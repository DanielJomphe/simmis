  "Development namespace - auto-loaded by Clojure REPL.

   Provides lifecycle management for:
   - nREPL server (port 47888) for CLJ access via clj-nrepl-eval
   - Shadow-cljs watcher with nREPL (port 9631) for CLJS access
   - Simmis web server (ws://localhost:47295)

   Usage:
     clj -A:dev              # Auto-starts everything

   From clj-nrepl-eval:
     clj-nrepl-eval -p 47888 \"(user/restart-web!)\"
     clj-nrepl-eval -p 9631 \"(js/console.log \\\"test\\\")\"

   Lifecycle:
     (start!) (stop!) (restart-web!) (status)

   Everything in `repl` is referred here too, so reading the running system
   needs no requires: (rooms) (parties) (knowledge-bases) (room \"slug\")
   (room-conn \"slug\") (conn) (db) (q '[:find ...]). Call (help) for the list."

   a record instance created before the reload no longer satisfies the
   protocol checked after it. If that happens, restart the JVM — do not try to
   debug it as an auth problem.
