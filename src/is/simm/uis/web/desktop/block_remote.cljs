  "Client-side remote block operations.

   These functions call the server via distributed-scope's invoke-remote.
   Each returns a core.async channel with the result.

   Each function accepts two optional trailing args:
   - `db-scope` — UUID of the KB to target (nil → shared DB).
   - `branch-kw` — keyword of the branch to target on that KB
                   (nil or `:db` → trunk). When provided, the server-side
                   handler routes the write through
                   `branching/get-kb-conn-on-branch`."
