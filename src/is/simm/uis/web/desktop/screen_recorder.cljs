  "Continuous screen recording (Track 4e) — the archive tier beside the live
   screenshot tier.

   Hangs a MediaRecorder on the SAME getDisplayMedia stream the screenshot loop
   is already sampling, so recording costs one encoder, not a second capture.
   The screenshot path is untouched: it keeps its 8s scene-change gate for the
   agents, while this keeps everything for later.

   ONE session per capture (doc/archive/screen-capture-scoping.md): the recording is the
   OWNER's archive, keyed server-side by the authenticated party (from the JWT),
   not by a room — so the upload URLs carry no room, and this holds a single
   session rather than a per-room map.

   Segmented, ~5 min apiece. MediaRecorder chunks are NOT independently
   playable — the first carries the container header, the rest are raw cluster
   continuations — so they are appended in order, and one lost chunk corrupts
   all that follow. A segment bounds that blast radius to itself, and lets
   segments upload and post-process in parallel. Cost: a seam of a frame or two
   at each rotation, which is cheap against losing an hour of capture.

   `start!` takes the stream rather than acquiring one, so a canvas
   captureStream can drive the whole path in a test without a screen picker.

   The binary chunk upload stays HTTP (blob size); the finalize marker rides the
   SAME queue so it lands AFTER the chunks it closes."
