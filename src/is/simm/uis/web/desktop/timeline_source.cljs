(ns is.simm.uis.web.desktop.timeline-source
  "Where the timeline rail's past comes from: the client's OWN replicas.

   The obvious source is the commit graph, and it is not available here. A
   commit record is stored under its commit-id, and datahike's konserve-sync
   walk-fn does not emit that key — it ships index nodes, the branch list, and
   each branch's head. So a freshly connected client holds ZERO historical
   commit records, and only sees commits made while its tab is open. On top of
   that yggdrasil's `Graphable` protocol is synchronous (`k/get … :sync? true`)
   against a client store whose IndexedDB backend asserts on sync ops, and
   yggdrasil is not in the CLJS bundle at all. Reaching it would mean changes to
   two upstream repos and a new browser dependency.

   None of which is needed, because the replicas are `:keep-history? true` and
   datahike commits 1:1 with transactions: every transaction's `:db/txInstant`
   datom is already in the local index. Querying THAT gives the same timeline,
   locally, live, with no round trip — and it updates as the replica syncs
   rather than needing an invalidation, which is what made the old RPC version
   read `No history loaded yet` and then never change.

   Content transactions only. Installing a store's schema and seed costs a few
   hundred transactions in a two-minute burst (measured: 228 of one KB's 476),
   and a history in which half the entries are `installed the schema` is worse
   than no history — it buries the writes a person actually made and makes
   scrubbing to `this morning` land in boot noise."

  "What changed between `cut-ms` and now, grouped by page, newest first.

   `[{:key :scope-name :page :n :last-ms :ts :author}]`. This is the AUDIT half
   of the Timelines view — the same question the proposal diff answers for a
   fork (`how does this state differ from the present?`) asked in the other
   direction.

   `:author` is the party uuid string off the NEWEST transaction in the group,
   the same one `:ts` comes from, or nil where the writer left no `:tx/author`.
   A page a person and an agent both edited therefore reads as whoever touched
   it last, which is the honest summary of a row that already collapses n edits
   into one line — the per-edit attribution is the page's own history, not this.

   Blocks that resolve to no page are dropped, and that is deliberate rather
   than lossy: they belong to a bootstrap page (see `page-resolver`), which is
   the store's own installation and not anybody's edit. Dropping real content
   would be a lie in a view whose whole job is accounting for change.

   This also used to catch `:fmap/*` UI-functor scaffolding — empty blocks the
   seed transacted into every store to feed a resolver that never once ran. The
   functor is gone; a store built after that has none. A store built BEFORE it

   Both sides come from the client's own replica — the live db for `after`,

   no `before` was added since the cut; one with no `after` was removed.
   Ordering follows the live db's `:block/order` where it has one, so the diff
   reads down the page rather than in query order.
