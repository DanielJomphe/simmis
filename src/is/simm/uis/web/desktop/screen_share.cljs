  "Share the local screen — ONE capture, per-room GRANTS
   (doc/archive/screen-capture-scoping.md).

   getDisplayMedia → hidden <video> → periodic canvas snapshot behind a
   scene-change gate → POST JPEG to /screen-frames (the caller's OWN stream;
   identity from the JWT, no room in the path). The server describes each frame
   with a VLM into the user's per-user buffer; which rooms may see it is decided
   by GRANTS, not by where it was posted.

   The share button is a GRANT toggle, not a capture switch. There is exactly one
   getDisplayMedia session: the first room you share into starts it (browser
   picker); every other room's toggle just opens/closes a grant over that same
   capture and heartbeats it; turning off the last grant stops the capture. So
   {personal, R2, R5} can receive your screen at once, and dropping one leaves
   the others untouched.

   The SAME stream feeds screen-recorder (Track 4e), the archive tier."
