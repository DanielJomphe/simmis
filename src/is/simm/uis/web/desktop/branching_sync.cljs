  "Client-side: keep `sig/kb-branches` in sync with server-side branch
   lifecycle events via the `:branching/event` kabel.pubsub topic.

   The server (see is.simm.model.branching-broadcast) publishes events of
   the form
     {:type :branch/created | :branch/discarded | :branch/merged
            | :branch/tx-occurred
      :db-scope <uuid-string>
      :branch   <branch-keyword>
      :parent   <branch-keyword>   ; on :created / :merged
      :commit   <commit-id-string> ; on :tx-occurred / :merged
      :author   <party-keyword>    ; future — currently nil
      :at       <inst>}

   We update the `kb-branches` signal accordingly. Branch metadata itself
   travels with the existing kabel store sync — by the time we receive
   the event, the local datahike conn typically already knows about the
   branch via `(d/branches local-conn)`. There is a small race we handle
   defensively in places that consume the local view.

   Client-side filtering: we only react to events for KBs in the current
   `user-rooms` data. Long-term this filter belongs on the server (per-KB
   topics + ACL); for v1 it's a hygiene measure here."
