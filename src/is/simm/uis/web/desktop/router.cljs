  "The URL, kept in step with the focused tab.

   REPLACES a hash router whose whole vocabulary was `#/` and `#/page/{uuid}`.
   That one was initialized at boot but inert: its route signal had zero
   readers, its only writer lived in `views/home.cljs` (itself unreachable), and
   `#/page/{uuid}` could not name a page in this data model at all, since page
   identity is (store, uuid). See `routes.cljc` for the contract that replaced
   it.

   THE URL IS A PROJECTION, not a second source of truth. One direction is a
   pure derivation — read the layout, derive the ref, write the path — and the
   only inbound edge is popstate. So the classic route↔layout fight has no cycle
   to suppress: there is simply one writer each way. `last-synced` is a VALUE
   guard on top of that, not a boolean re-entrancy flag: the legs settle
   asynchronously, and a boolean around an async effect is exactly how these
   designs break.

   WHAT IS USED FROM SPINDEL, and what is not. `navigate!`/`replace!` are the
   only push/replaceState implementation in either repo, and the replace half is
   what keeps tab switching out of browser history. NOT used: `start!` and the
   `router` macro — the entire browser half of that namespace is untested
   (16 deftests, 11 of them `#?(:clj` guarded; `start!` has none), and we
   already have a tested path parser in `routes.cljc`. Adding `#?(:cljs …)`
   arms there is worth doing upstream; adopting an untested boot path to get
   parsing we already have is not."
