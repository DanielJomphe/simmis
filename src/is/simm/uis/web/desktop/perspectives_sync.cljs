  "Keep the perspectives live, so none of them needs a Refresh button.

   Feed, Tasks, Accounting and Proposals are server-side aggregates fetched by
   RPC, which made them stale the moment anything changed and left each view
   with a button asking the user to do the system's job. The reactive pattern
   already existed here — `user-rooms-sync`, `message-notify-sync` and
   `branching-sync` all invalidate on a kabel pubsub nudge — it had simply not
   been applied to the newer views.

   Events, from the topic that already carries them:
     :branch/tx-occurred               a KB changed        → Feed, Tasks
     :branch/created|merged|discarded  a fork branch moved → Feed, Tasks, Proposals
     :proposal/tx-occurred             a ForkSet was filed
                                       or resolved         → Feed, Tasks, Proposals
     :book/tx-occurred                 a room's book moved → Accounting

   This namespace holds NO timing logic. Coalescing belongs to the gate beside
   each fetch (`uis.desktop.aggregate`); an earlier version guarded here as
   well, and the two guards defeated each other — the view's own flag made a
   dropped fetch look completed, so a write arriving mid-fetch was never
   reflected. Asking for a refresh is all this does.

   It registers with `branching-sync` rather than opening a second subscription:
   `:branching/event` already has an owner, and subscribing twice installs a
   competing strategy for one topic instead of adding a listener."
