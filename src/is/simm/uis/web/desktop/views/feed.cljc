  "Feed — what is happening, from the system and from every room.

   The rows are heterogeneous on purpose: a deployment announcement and a page
   an agent wrote overnight are both \"what happened\", and splitting them would
   make the answer to \"anything new?\" take two looks. Each row says where it
   came from (`is.simm.ops.feed` assembles them).

   Distinct from Timelines' Changed panel, which shares data but answers a
   different question: that one is provenance at a chosen reference, this one
   is attention at now."
