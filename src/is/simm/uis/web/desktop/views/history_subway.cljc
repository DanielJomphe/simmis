  "History subway (S4): the KB's yggdrasil commit graph as a clickable
   backbone in the wiki context panel. Today the history is linear (one
   :db branch, one commit per transaction), so this renders as a vertical
   rail of recent commits grouped by day; clicking a commit jumps the
   GlobalCut to that commit's timestamp (the slider + subway share one
   ref). Fork lanes light up once proposals create branches — the
   :branch badge + rail colour are already keyed on it.
