  "Timelines — the workspace at a reference.

   Not a dashboard of leftovers. Every panel here answers the SAME question,
   `what is true at this reference?`, and the reference is the one the whole
   app already resolves reads through (`sig/global-ref`, and
   `db-signal/ensure-view-db-signal!` behind it):

     a past cut  → what the workspace looked like then
     now         → what is live
     a fork      → what would be true if that ForkSet landed

   ONE OPERATION, SIGN FLIPPED. Auditing the past and exploring an option look
   like different features and are the same question — `how does this state
   differ from the present?` — asked in opposite directions. A past cut shows
   what changed between then and now; a fork shows what would change if it
   landed. So they share a surface, and the rail is the view's input rather
   than an ornament: moving it re-evaluates everything below.

   What each direction needs BEYOND that shared core is where they part, and it
   is worth naming because it is the roadmap. Audit wants attribution — who
   changed this, and why it was accepted. The accept rationale is recorded, and
   `:tx/author` now rides on the transaction (schema.clj `provenance-schema`),
   so a change CAN be named — for the writers that set it. Seeded wiki writes
   do; the interactive editor does not yet, and an unattributed row says the
   date and nothing else rather than inventing a person. Options want
   consequence — what this would cost — which is what `:budget` intent is for
   and why the book matters.

   Plural deliberately: there is one past and many futures. The rail is
   continuous to the left (time is a total order — every instant maps to
   exactly one state) and DISCRETE to the right (a future is not a distance,
   it is a branch; with three open ForkSets there are three, and no meaning
   whatever between them). A symmetric slider would promise a continuum the
   data cannot deliver, so the two halves are drawn differently on purpose."

;; =============================================================================

;; The past used to come from `branching-remote/kb-commit-graph!` — an RPC per
;; scope, fired only when a wiki tab happened to be open, behind a latch that
;; was never released. So the rail read "No history loaded yet" for anyone who
;; opened Timelines directly, and never moved once loaded. It now derives from
;; the replicas the client already holds; see `timeline-source`.
;;
;; A CUT BEFORE THE STORE WAS INSTALLED is reachable from this rail, and the
;; panels below are not the only readers of it. Seeded content is backdated to
;; the months the scenario describes (`demo.scenario/provenance`), so a dot far
;; enough left puts the workspace at a reference where the seed entities do not
;; exist yet — and a query that names one through a lookup ref,
;; `[?e :instance/of-role [:entity/name "S/Page"]]`, THROWS there rather than
;; returning nothing (measured: `Nothing found for entity id [:entity/name
;; "S/Page"]`). The panels here read plain attributes and were never affected.
;;
;; Closed from both ends (2026-07-27). Stores we seed are installed at the
;; scenario's earliest instant, so their schema and seed are older than their
;; content (`store/install!`'s `at`, threaded from `demo.scenario`), and the
;; page query resolves the role as a value first, so a store nobody back-dated
;; reports an empty wiki instead of throwing (`datahike-query/page-role-eid`).
;; Scrubbing past the beginning of a store is now an ordinary, boring place.
