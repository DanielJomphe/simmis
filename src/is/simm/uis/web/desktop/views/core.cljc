   The label follows the type rather than forcing one noun on all of them:
   \"Team\" fits a group room and is plainly wrong for one human and their
   assistant. doc/archive/navigation-redesign-plan.md, Phase 5.

   The word `room` stays in the code, the schema and the agent vocabulary —
   dvergr owns the concept and we just made `dvergr.room` discoverable to
   agents, so a vocabulary split would undo that. The synonym is stated
   explicitly in the agent's context instead (see `room_agents`)."

  ;; agents working together — a Team), :personal-ai, :telegram-mirror.
