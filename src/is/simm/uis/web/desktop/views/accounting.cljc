  "Accounting — the workspace's position, one book per team.

   Every simmis store carries the kontor kernel, so there is no single ledger:
   each team keeps its own book and this view is the index over them. The
   figures come from the SAME per-book trial balance a team page would show,
   never a roll-up maintained alongside — a second source of truth for money is
   the worst place to have one (see `is.simm.ops.accounting-report`).

   A book that cannot be read keeps its row and states why. A team missing from
   a financial summary is worse than a visible failure, because the total still
   looks like a total."
