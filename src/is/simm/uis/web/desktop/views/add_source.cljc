  "Add memory / Add team — one entry point per section, both verbs.

   `Create` makes an empty local thing. `Connect` attaches an existing outside
   one. They share an entry point because the user's intent is one — give the
   workspace something — and because a type-named \"New X\" button can never
   express connecting, which is not a new anything.

   For memory, connecting sets an UPSTREAM on a local replica: the content is
   replicated in and the local copy is what you read, fork, search and
   time-travel. dvergr's geschichte substrate already does exactly this for
   repositories (import, record `remote.upstream.url`, read locally). That is
   what keeps a connected source from becoming a second class of memory the
   copy-on-write story cannot reach.

   For teams the same thing is already true and shipped: dvergr's telegram
   channel creates a room when its bot is added to a group. So a team is not
   only something you make here — it can ARRIVE — and the list says so instead
   of pretending creation is the only route.

   Sources that are not built yet are LISTED and disabled with the reason. A
   picker that silently omits Slack answers \"can simmis do this?\" with
   \"apparently not\"; one that names it as not-yet answers correctly."
