  "Tasks as a VIEW over sources, not a table.

   Three things in this system are legitimately \"something to do\", and they
   live in three places for good reasons (doc/archive/navigation-redesign-plan.md,
   \"Resolved: S/Task vs dvergr :task/*\"):

     :page      an `S/Task` page in a KB — the durable work item, part of the
                wiki graph, forkable, proposable.
     :forkset   a landable ForkSet — a proposed change that is ready to merge
                IS a thing to do, and the user asked for exactly that: \"a
                proposal that is ready is a task\".
     :dispatch  a dvergr `:task/*` row — one actor asking another to do
                something. dvergr owns it; this namespace only reads it.

   Each source gets a small adapter to one shape, and the aggregate is a
   fan-out at read time. There is deliberately NO persisted index: KB pages are
   written by the client through konserve-sync replicas, which a server-side
   listener does not observe as tx reports, so an index would silently miss half
   the writes. A `can?`-filtered query per visible KB has no derived state to go
   wrong, and the KB count is small. Revisit under measurement, rebuild-first.

   Visibility is `access/can?` per KB, the one authorization seam — a global
   task list is exactly where a task from an invisible project would leak."
