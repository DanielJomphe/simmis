  "Do a code fork's tests pass?

   A proposal card shows what CHANGED and says nothing about whether it WORKS.
   For an agent-authored change that gap matters more than for a human-authored
   one, not less: reading a diff tells a reviewer what was intended, and the
   thing they actually want to know is whether it runs. A card that says
   \"37 tests pass on this branch\" turns review from reading and hoping into
   trusting a gate.

   Runs INDEPENDENTLY of the agent, which is the whole point. An agent could
   report its own test results, but a self-reported check is not a check — it
   is a claim, and the reviewer already has the agent's claim in the rationale.

   Isolation comes free from the fork machinery: a check opens a workspace on
   the branch (the same primitive an agent writes through), loads the fork's own
   test namespaces into a FRESH sandbox through that workspace's filesystem, and
   discards it. Nothing on the daemon's classpath is visible, and nothing the
   check does can reach trunk."
