  "The workspace's financial position, assembled from the per-book query.

   Every simmis store carries the kontor kernel (`model.store/install!` —
   that is the point of one store kind), so \"the books\" is not one ledger but
   one per team. This namespace answers the GLOBAL question by running the same
   per-book report over each book the caller can read and labelling the rows,
   never by maintaining a second aggregate.

   That rule is the whole reason a global Accounting view and a per-team cost
   figure are not double work: they are the same query at two scopes. A
   parallel roll-up would be a second source of truth for money, which is the
   worst possible place to have one."

   `trial-balance` takes the CONN, not a db value: the whole report is one
   snapshot resolved internally, so every account is read at the same
   `:as-of-tx` and a write landing mid-report cannot produce a trial balance
   that fails to balance for no visible reason.

   It returns `{account-eid {commodity-eid Money}}`, so the eids are resolved
   here. kontor has a display-keyed `trial-balance-readable` that does exactly
   this, but it is not in the released 0.1.3 — swap to it when kontor ships it,
   rather than growing this. Resolving names against a later `d/db` than the
   report's snapshot is safe for the two attributes read: an account's path and
   a commodity's symbol are its identity, not its balance."

   a new empty entity instead of being refused — and `trial-balance` then never
