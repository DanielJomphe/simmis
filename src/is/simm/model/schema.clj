(ns is.simm.model.schema
  "Categorical schema definitions for Simmis.

   This schema implements a category-theoretic approach where:
   - Everything is a Block (pages, nested blocks, schema objects, morphisms, functors)
   - Schema is data (queryable entities, not code)
   - Properties are morphisms with dynamic attribute installation
   - Relations are hypergraphs (objects with role morphisms)
   - UI rendering via functors (S → Comp)

   Core categories:
   - S (Schema): entity types, value types, properties, relations
   - Comp (UI Components): Card, Table, Text, etc.
   - Cat₀ (Categories): meta-category containing S, Comp, etc.

   Chat/message schema is provided by dvergr (dvergr.chat.schema).
   Design rationale: doc/current-categorical-model.md."
