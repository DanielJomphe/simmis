(ns is.simm.model.message-notify-broadcast
  "Server-side per-user mention notifications. When a chat message @mentions
   parties, publish a private notification to each mentioned party's OWN topic
   `:notify/<party-id>` — auth-gated to that party in
   `web/data-plane-authorized?`, so a payload only ever reaches its recipient
   (no shared-topic client-side filtering).

   Beyond the fan-out (`notify-message!`, which never notifies the author),
   this namespace owns the per-room notification preference
   (`notify-pref-level` / `set-notify-pref!`) and the per-room read cursors
   that unread counts are derived from (`set-read-cursor!`, `mark-read!`,
   `unread-counts-for-party`). Design note:
