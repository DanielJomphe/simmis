  "Screen-share grants — a time-boxed window in which one room may see a user's
   screen capture (doc/archive/screen-capture-scoping.md).

   Capture is owned by the user; a grant is the ONLY thing that makes a slice of
   it visible to a room. The share button toggles a grant, not a capture. A grant
   is `active` while its `:until` is absent AND its heartbeat is fresh — so a
   client that dies mid-share fails the window SAFE (the room stops seeing the
   stream) rather than leaking indefinitely.

   Grants live in the shared system DB next to rooms and parties."
