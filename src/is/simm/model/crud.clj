(defn create-block!
  "Create a new block with optional roles and properties.

   Options:
   - :name - entity/name (required for top-level blocks)
   - :roles - vector of role entity-names (e.g., ['S/Block' 'S/Tag'])
   - :parent - UUID of parent block (nil for top-level)
   - :order - fractional index string for ordering (auto-generated if nil)
   - :content - HTML content
   - :properties - map of property values {attr-ident value}
                   e.g., {:S.Block/title 'My Title'}
   - :at - the instant this block is to have HAPPENED at, stamped on both the
           row and the transaction (`:db/txInstant`). Omitted → wall clock, the
           only correct answer for a live write. Supplied by installers that
           back-date a store to the beginning of its narrative time, so a cut
           taken before the store existed in wall-clock terms still finds the
