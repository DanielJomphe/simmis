  "Drives — per-room-attachable file systems (doc/archive/file-system-design.md).

   A drive is a dedicated system type in the shared registry
   (:system/type :fs), mirroring KBs: a registry row in the system DB,
   its own Datahike database holding the fs.node TREE, registered as an
   yggdrasil system (fork/merge/sync conformance for free), attached to
   rooms via :grant/* rows. File CONTENT lives in the content-addressed
   blob store (is.simm.model.blobs); the tree references blobs by hash.

   Drives hold raw documents; KBs hold derived knowledge. The
   auto-indexer (a later intake step) walks a drive and publishes into
   a KB fork with :derived-from qualified refs {drive, node}.

   API-FIRST: all consumers (agent fs_* tools, web panel, intake
   indexer) go through ls / read-file / put-file! / mkdir! / mv! / rm!
   — the datahike fs.node schema is an implementation detail, so a
   CAS-native merkle tree can replace it later as a custom yggdrasil
   system without consumer rewrites."
