  "Op-based topic-page merging — the second summarizer.

   Merging is NOT page rewriting: claims extracted from a chat summary
   are classified per linked page as ADD / UPDATE / NOOP ops, each op
   adversarially grounding-checked against the summary text before it
   lands (drop-and-log on failure — the measured toggle that decides
   whether a given model needs reviewing at all). Landed blocks carry a
   stored :block/references ref to the summary RECORD page — provenance
   as backlinks, zero new schema; dh:// record-refs when datahike#852
   ships. Bad merges stay cheap: datahike history + KB branching."
