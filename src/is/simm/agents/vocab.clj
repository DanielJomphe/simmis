(ns is.simm.agents.vocab
  "Give the agent's SCI vocabulary the metadata a Clojure developer expects.

   THE PROBLEM. dvergr already surfaces signatures: `dvergr.sandbox` reads
   `(meta v)` off every injected value and reports `:arglists` and `:doc`, and
   `dev/doc` prints them. But simmis injects its whole vocabulary as bare
   anonymous fns —

     {'ensure-page! (fn [db title] …)}

   — and `(fn …)` carries no metadata, so every one of those contributed
   NOTHING. `dvergr.sandbox` says as much in a comment: \"raw injected fns carry
   no :doc/:arglists\". The agent's only way to learn an arity was to call the
   fn and read the error, which is exactly what we saw: a turn that transacted
   `{:schedule/id nil}` because there was no way to discover the right call.

   THE FIX is small because the machinery already exists — attach the metadata
   and dvergr's introspection lights up. `with-docs` keeps the documentation as
   DATA beside the namespace rather than restructuring the fn maps, so adding a
   verb and documenting it stay one small edit apart and the docs can also be
   rendered outside SCI.

   A missing entry is not an error: undocumented verbs still work, they are just
   invisible to `doc`. That keeps this incremental instead of a flag day."
