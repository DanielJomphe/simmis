   state the DEFAULT state: kabel-auth's dev handler takes any email, CREATES
   the account if it does not exist, marks it `:user/email-verified true`, and
   returns real tokens. Every fresh clone — the state a new user is in for
   their whole first session — shipped a complete authentication bypass.

   The two concerns were never the same question. \"Do I have a configured
   signing secret?\" is answered by `jwt-secret`, which already falls back to a
   persisted dev secret so local development works without any env var at all.
   \"May anyone mint a token for any address?\" has to be asked, and answered,
   on its own.

   Nothing in simmis calls `/auth/dev`: the client logs in through

   whole. MEASURED 2026-08-20 against a running server: an anonymous
   `POST /auth/register` returned 201 with a user id, `/auth/login` then
   returned a real access token, and that token was accepted by
   `POST /blobs` — anonymous to authenticated in two requests, on a server
   whose documentation promised the door was not there. An account is also
   the whole gate for the ~24 RPCs policed as `:authenticated`.
