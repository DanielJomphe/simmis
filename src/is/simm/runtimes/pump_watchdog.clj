  "ALARM-ONLY observability for the room bus. There is deliberately no
   healing here — the failure classes this module was born from are fixed
   at their roots:

   - lost wakeups / silent pump wedges: spindel ≥0.1.35 (#27 redesign —
     failure routing, transactional handoffs, thread-safe buffers);
   - unrecoverable pump position: dvergr's durable-cursor bus (log-first
     fan-out; the pump is supervised and resumes from its cursor).

   What remains here:
   (1) `install-fault-reporter!` routes the ENGINE-WIDE spindel fault hook
       into Telemere (continuation faults, executor-task faults, pubsub
       watcher/pump faults — spindel carries no logging dep);
   (2) a per-minute probe of every live room's bus. Under the
       durable-cursor model the meaningful signal is CURSOR LAG — a log
       head that stays ahead of the fan-out cursor across consecutive
       probes means the supervised pump is not draining (its restart
       budget may be exhausted → look for the ::pump-fatal fault).
       The mult stage is probed too ({:queue N>0 :waiters 0} = deaf).

   If an alarm here ever fires, it is a BUG REPORT with evidence — never
   a recovery path."
