  "Live screen sharing WITH AGENTS (Track 4c), scoped by USER
   (doc/archive/screen-capture-scoping.md).

   A user's screen CAPTURE is owned by the user: frames are described by
   dvergr.media.vision and stored in the USER's screens DB
   (`data/simmis-screens/<party-id>`) and a per-user hot ring buffer. The
   client posts to `/screen-frames` — no room in the path; the sharer's identity
   comes from the JWT.

   A room sees a user's stream only through an active GRANT
   (`is.simm.model.screen-grants`): the share button toggles a time-boxed window,
   not a capture. The agent reads it through the `screen/*` SCI vocabulary
   (`sci-namespace`), which resolves the room's active grants → the parties
   sharing into it → their recent frames as DATA, ATTRIBUTED by name. So an agent
   can tell whose screen it is looking at and PROGRAM over it, and a member's raw
   frames are never pooled where the room can browse them — the room gets the
   agent-mediated view; the owner's gallery (search-own) shows their own stream.

   DELIBERATELY NOT chat messages: auto-respond agents would reply to every
   frame. Agents PULL via `screen/*` in clojure_eval — it is a sandbox
   vocabulary, not a bespoke tool."
