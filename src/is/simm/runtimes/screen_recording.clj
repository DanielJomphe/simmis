  "Continuous screen RECORDING (Track 4e) — the archive tier under the live
   screenshot tier.

   Two tiers, deliberately, because they do different jobs:

     screen-intake   a described frame every ~8s behind a scene-change gate.
                     Cheap, immediate, small enough to sit in a tool result.
                     Agents read it NOW, through `screen_look`. It DISCARDS —
                     that is its purpose.

     screen-recording (this)  the raw stream, gapless, kept. Nobody reads it
                     live. It exists to be RE-INTERPRETED later, by whatever
                     the best VLM is that month, at whatever cadence the
                     question needs.

   The two share a clock, and that is the whole point: a screenshot's
   `:screenshot/at` minus a session's `:recording.session/started-at` is a
   TIMECODE into the video. The cheap description index we already build thus
   becomes a searchable index INTO the raw recording — search a phrase, land at
   the moment. Neither tier gives you that alone.

   Wire format. The browser's MediaRecorder emits chunks that are NOT
   independently playable: the first carries the container header, the rest are
   raw cluster continuations. So chunks are APPENDED, in order, into one file
   per segment — and one lost chunk corrupts everything after it. Hence
   segments (default 5 min, rotated client-side): a valid file on its own, a
   dropped chunk costs one segment rather than the session, and segments
   finalize and post-process in parallel. The price is a seam of a frame or two
   at each rotation — cheap against losing an hour.

   Layout:  data/simmis-recordings/<owner-uuid>/<session-uuid>/seg-<n>.<ext>

   OWNERSHIP (doc/archive/screen-capture-scoping.md): a recording is the OWNER's archive,
   keyed by the sharing party (from the JWT), not by a room. Rooms see slices of
   it only through an active screen-share grant (v2 for the room-side playback;
   v1 keys the store per owner so that view is a query, not a migration). The
   route is authenticated (`hauth/require-auth`); the owner is the caller."
