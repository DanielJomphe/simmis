  "Authentication and size limits for the HTTP media routes.

   These routes shipped with NO auth at all — the comment said \"same auth
   posture as /blobs until eacl lands\", and /blobs's posture was: none. Proven
   against the live box: an anonymous

       curl -X POST https://dev.simm.is/blobs --data-binary @anything

   returned a blob id and wrote to our disk. Anyone on the internet could fill
   it. The room-scoped routes were worse than merely open: a stranger holding a
   room uuid could post screen frames, and each frame costs a VLM call — an
   unauthenticated endpoint that spends money.

   The machinery to prevent this ALREADY EXISTED and was simply never wired up:
   kabel's `build-bearer-validator` returns (fn [ring-req] → principal-or-nil)
   for exactly this. So the fix is not new security infrastructure — it is using
   the security infrastructure we have, with the same secret and the same
   trusted-issuer registry as the websocket plane. One identity story, two
   transports.

   Membership, not just authentication: a logged-in user is not thereby entitled
   to write into someone else's room. Room-scoped routes check `:room/parties`.

   And a size cap BEFORE the bytes are read. `.readAllBytes` on a request body
   is an unbounded heap allocation controlled by the caller: a 2GB POST is a 2GB
   array. Content-Length is a claim, not a fact, so we cap the READ as well —
   a lying header buys nothing."

;; The fix is not a third guard to remember. It is to make the declaration
;; MANDATORY and to check it at BOOT: `validate-auth-declared!` runs as
